# No AI Branding in Git Commits

**NEVER** include AI tool names, branding, advertising, or attribution in git commit messages, branch names, PR descriptions, or code comments. This applies to all AI tools without exception.

## Banned Tool Names

Do not reference any of these (or similar) in commits or trailers:

Claude, Cursor, Copilot, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, GPT-4, GPT-4o, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Google Gemini, Windsurf, Codeium, Tabnine, Amazon Q, CodeWhisperer, Sourcegraph Cody, Replit AI, Devin, Aider, Continue, JetBrains AI

## Banned Patterns

- Attribution phrases: "Generated by", "Created with", "Made with", "Built with", "Written by", "Authored by", "Assisted by", "Powered by", "Suggested by", "Produced by", "Refactored by", "Fixed by" followed by any AI tool name
- Git trailers: `Co-authored-by:`, `Signed-off-by:`, `Reviewed-by:`, or any trailer referencing an AI tool
- Marketing language: "AI-powered", "AI-generated", "AI-assisted", "LLM-assisted", "LLM-generated", "machine-generated"
- Emoji markers that imply AI authorship (robot emoji, sparkle emoji, brain emoji as commit prefixes)
- Any other phrasing whose purpose is to advertise or attribute work to an AI tool

## Examples

BAD commit messages:

```
Add user authentication (Generated by Claude)
feat: add login form - Created with Cursor
Co-authored-by: Claude <claude@anthropic.com>
Refactored by Copilot
🤖 Auto-generated commit
```

GOOD commit messages:

```
Add user authentication
feat: add login form with validation
Refactor payment module for readability
Fix null check in profile loader
```

## Enforcement

A `commit-msg` git hook in `scripts/commit-msg` automatically strips AI branding lines from commit messages. Install it after cloning:

```bash
cp scripts/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg && chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```
