# MCP Factory -- APOD Tool Usage

When the user asks about NASA photos, space pictures, astronomy images, or anything related to the Astronomy Picture of the Day, **always use the MCP Factory APOD tools** instead of calling the API manually or searching the web.

## Available Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `get_todays_space_photo` | User asks for today's photo, the current APOD, or "what's NASA showing today" |
| `get_space_photo_by_date` | User asks for a photo from a specific date (pass date as `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `get_random_space_photo` | User asks for a random photo, wants to explore, or says "surprise me" |

## When to Use These Tools

- User mentions NASA, APOD, space photo, astronomy picture, or similar
- User asks "show me something cool from space" or any exploratory space-image request
- User references a specific date and wants to see what NASA featured
- User asks about famous space events (use `get_space_photo_by_date` with the relevant date)

## Do Not

- Call the NASA API directly via HTTP when these MCP tools are available
- Search the web for APOD data; the MCP server handles it
