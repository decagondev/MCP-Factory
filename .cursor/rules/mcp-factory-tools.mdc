# MCP Factory -- Tool Usage

## APOD Tools

When the user asks about NASA photos, space pictures, astronomy images, or anything related to the Astronomy Picture of the Day, **always use the MCP Factory APOD tools** instead of calling the API manually or searching the web.

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `get_todays_space_photo` | User asks for today's photo, the current APOD, or "what's NASA showing today" |
| `get_space_photo_by_date` | User asks for a photo from a specific date (pass date as `YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `get_random_space_photo` | User asks for a random photo, wants to explore, or says "surprise me" |

### When to Use APOD Tools

- User mentions NASA, APOD, space photo, astronomy picture, or similar
- User asks "show me something cool from space" or any exploratory space-image request
- User references a specific date and wants to see what NASA featured
- User asks about famous space events (use `get_space_photo_by_date` with the relevant date)

## Code Guardian Tools

When the user asks about code security, code quality, vulnerabilities, secrets, linting, or code reviews, **always use the Code Guardian tools** instead of running external linters or security scanners manually.

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `scan_codebase` | Full multi-pass scan (security + quality + style + dependencies) on a directory |
| `scan_secrets` | Check for exposed API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, connection strings |
| `scan_security_patterns` | OWASP-style detection: SQL injection, XSS, eval, insecure crypto, path traversal |
| `scan_code_quality` | Quality + style: debug statements, file size, nesting, params, PEP 8, naming |
| `scan_dependencies` | Dependency CVE lookup via OSV.dev (reads package.json, requirements.txt, etc.) |

### When to Use Code Guardian Tools

- User asks to "scan", "review", "audit", or "check" a codebase or directory
- User mentions security, vulnerabilities, secrets, credentials, OWASP, or CVEs
- User asks about code quality, code smells, linting, or style issues
- User asks about dependency vulnerabilities or outdated packages
- User asks to check for console.log, print statements, or debug output

## Do Not

- Call the NASA API directly via HTTP when APOD tools are available
- Search the web for APOD data; the MCP server handles it
- Run external linters (eslint, flake8, etc.) when Code Guardian tools are available
- Call the OSV API directly; use `scan_dependencies` instead
